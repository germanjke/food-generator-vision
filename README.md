Our project builds upon the foundation of the [swift-coreml-diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-diffusers) library, which, in turn, inherits its functionality from the renowned Python library, [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), developed by [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface). This powerful lineage ensures that our application leverages state-of-the-art techniques and models to deliver impressive results.

Experience the simplicity of creating your own application that can perform inference directly on your MacBook with M1/M2 processors, without the need for dedicated GPU resources. Explore the world of stable diffusion models and harness their potential within your macOS projects. Join us in shaping the future of machine learning on macOS!
